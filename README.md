## Project Overview

### How to Run ?

1. Copy the files ina a folder. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.
 
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. 
If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 
For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`,
